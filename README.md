# multinational-retail-data-centralisation26

# Background 
I work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

In an effort to become more data-driven, my organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

My first goal was to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

I then wish to query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

# Milestones 

## Milestone 1 
Setting up the development enviroment and github repository. 

## Milestone 2
Extracting and Cleaning all the data from a multitude of data sources, creating a local database and storing clean data there.

## Milestone 3
Creating a star based schema ensuring columns are of the correct data types

## Milestone 4
Querying the data to answer business questions:

How many stores does the business have and in which countries?

Which locations currently have the most stores?

Which months produce the most sales typically?

How many sales are coming from online?

What percentage of sales come through each type of store?

Which month in each year produced the most sales?

What is our staff headcount?

Which German store type is selling the most?

How quickly is the company making sales?

# How to run
I would suggest running the database_utils.py file in VSCode.
